DESCRIPTION:Generative text models are a class of artificial intelligence systems designed to produce human-like text based on given input. They have become increasingly important in natural language processing (NLP), powering applications such as chatbots, automated content generation, translation, summarization, and virtual assistants. Two widely recognized approaches in this field are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT). Although both aim to generate coherent text, they differ significantly in architecture, learning methodology, and performance.

LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that were introduced to address the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients in traditional RNNs. LSTMs include memory cells that can store and retrieve information over long sequences, enabling them to capture dependencies across time. In the context of text generation, LSTM models are trained on large text corpora, learning the statistical structure of language.

When generating text, the LSTM takes a sequence of words (or characters) as input and predicts the most likely next token. By iteratively feeding the modelâ€™s output back into itself, it can produce sentences or paragraphs that resemble the training data. Although LSTMs are effective in learning sequential patterns, they have limitations in capturing very long-term dependencies and often produce repetitive or less contextually rich text compared to modern models.
